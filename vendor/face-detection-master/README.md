# Face Detection in JavaScript with getUserMedia

Adapted to work with the getUserMedia API using code from [github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection](https://github.com/wesbos/HTML5-Face-Detection)

[Try out the demo](http://neave.github.com/face-detection/) using Google Chrome with the "MediaStream" flag enabled in about:flags

Note that this demo only works online (or localhost) due to security restrictions. It won't work on a local file:/// system!

**Also recommended is [headtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr) which is a more sophisticated face- and head-tracking JavaScript library.**
